# For Community members

Everything you are concerned with lives in the content directory. All pages in /content use Markdown formatting rather than raw html. Here's a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for Markdown if you need some help getting the formatting you want.

##To edit a page:
* find it in /content (or perhaps /content/people)
* click on it
* select the little icon that looks like a pencil in the upper right of the text pane
* edit the text however you want
* once everything looks good, run down to the box below the text pane that says "Commit chnages", and
  * put a very brief description of the changes you made into the first box; eg. "Added basic instructions to the README"
  * ensure that "Commit directly to the `master` branch." is selected
  * click the "Commit changes" button
  * (THIS PART IS STILL IN PROGRESS BUT NOT FULLY OPERATIONAL) After ~20 seconds, the live website should be updated with your changes. Test by browsing to the site and being sure to refresh the particular page(s) you edited.


# For anyone else who is looking at this repo

Did a Red Earth member send you here to find editable versions of our basic documents? If so, look under `content/docs/editable` to find open-document versions of some of our documents.

There isn't anything available here that isn't available directly from our website, except for some of the python scripts that make the sausage.
