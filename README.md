# For Community members

Everything you are concerned with lives in the content directory. All pages in /content use Markdown formatting rather than raw html. Here's a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for Markdown if you need some help getting the formatting you want.

##To edit a page:
* find it in /content (or perhaps /content/people)
* click on it
* select the little icon that looks like a pencil in the upper right of the text pane
* edit the text however you want
* once everything looks good, run down to the box below the text pane that says "Commit chnages", and
  * put a very brief description of the changes you made into the first box; eg. "Added basic instructions to the README"
  * ensure that "Commit directly to the `master` branch." is selected
  * click the "Commit changes" button
  * (THIS PART ISN'T SET UP YET) After ~20 seconds, the live website should be updated with your changes. Test by browsing to the site and being sure to refresh the particular page(s) you edited.
  

# For anyone else who is looking at this repo

There isn't anything available here that isn't available directly from our website, except for some of the python scripts that make the sauage.
