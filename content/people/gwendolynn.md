Title: Gwendolynn

I was born in Washington. I am five, almost six. Even though I am small, I do a lot of work on the farm. I also really enjoy doing school work. I am the “goat whisperer”. I can talk to lots of goats and make them more friendly. We have had some goats that don’t like people very much and they need more love.

I help my sisters haul water, collect eggs and feed the animals. I am really good at telling everyone what they should be doing.
