I live on my homestead, Coyote Song, with a dog that I love and a cat that I donâ€™t quite understand.  My house was built by friends, and is very comfortable, functional and sweet.  My land is open and full of potential.  I plan to keep planting trees and perennials and expand my garden- to make a beautiful and edible landscape.   I dream of building a barn one day, and of tending to chickens and goats.

I am an organic inspector, financially supporting myself by visiting organic farmers, reviewing their farming practices, and writing reports. This means that I currently travel a lot during the summer. One day I hope to retire from that career and be a homebody at C-song.

I like to sing, dance, run, laugh, garden, build.  I like to talk about things that people hold dear.  I like to play creatively with kids.  I like to be absurd and silly.  I like to create efficient systems.

I value connection with family, with friends and neighbors, with domestic and wild animals, with the food I eat, with the land I tend.  I value quality, efficiency and aesthetics.  I appreciate tools and objects that are well-designed, systems that run smoothly, and views that are calming.

I choose to live at Red Earth Farms because it allows me to maintain a good balance of interacting with others while holding and pursuing my own vision.  I feel known, loved and authentic here.
