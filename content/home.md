Red Earth Farms is an intentional community of homesteads sharing a 76-acre land trust in the rolling hills of northeast Missouri. Our community’s mission is to creatively explore and evaluate sustainable ways to meet our needs in accordance with our guiding principle: “Love the land; love your neighbors.”

Members choose how they personally want to pursue this mission. As a group we value diversity, cooperation, and nonviolence; make our decisions by consensus; and do our best to live with honor and respect for all the beings around us.

We see Red Earth Farms as one positive alternative to an increasingly unsustainable and isolating mainstream culture. By building and valuing our connections with the land, with other people, and with ourselves, we believe we are helping to create a better future. If this vision speaks to you, we invite you to contact us about a visit, participate in our activities, and consider joining us as a member.
