Title: Our Land
Date: 2016-08-22

Our community is located on 76 acres of rolling hills in northeast Missouri, with six ponds, several wooded areas, and a small creek. We are on a gravel road less than a mile from [Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage](http://www.dancingrabbit.org/) and about three miles from [Sandhill Farm](http://www.sandhillfarm.org/). The small town of Rutledge is three miles away, and the hardware stores and public schools are about 12 miles away in Memphis, MO.

Below is a map of our homesteads and their leaseholds. At this time, leasehold C, leasehold E and leasehold F are the plots of land potentially available for lease to incoming members. It is possible that current leaseholders could make land available to folks who are interested in joining Red Earth Farms. There are also existing homesteads looking for additional folks to join them.

Please see [this page](https://bindlefarmblog.wordpress.com/) for more information on leasehold C.
