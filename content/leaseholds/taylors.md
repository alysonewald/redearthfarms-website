Title: The Taylors

Our leasehold is 14 acres of south-sloping land, north of the creek that divides REF roughly in half. We're currently the only leasehold at REF with livestock other than poultry. We raise goats, sheep, horses, chickens, ducks, and geese. 

Goats
===
Most of our goats are Nigerian Dwarf goats from good dairy lines, but we also have a single standard Nubian and a Nubian-Nigey cross. Our ladies keep up in milk for about 5 months of the year. We use the milk for drinking, cooking, yogurt, kefir, and cheesemaking.
