**Natural Building & Homesteading internship at Gooseberry Farm:**
We’re Mark, Alyson, and Cole and for seven years we’ve been working and playing with the homestead we call Gooseberry Farm. As we create our home we’re learning about growing food, building with natural materials, raising a healthy child, and building relationships with our neighbors. We like to share what we’ve learned, so if you want to find out first-hand what it takes to get started on your own homestead, please consider interning with us this summer.
